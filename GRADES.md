### Comments
First of all congrats on finishing the course and final task !!!

TBH, the project seems very messy:
- `README` file seems to have alot of info, which made me to get lost in the project.
- `README` suppose to be introduction to project, with small code snippets and not suppose to have precise
- Scripts are straight forward commands and do not include nothing we discussed on out last meetings.
- Logos are nice, but they are not suppose to be dropped around the project
- Although the scripts have print outs, it is not clear whether they are successful or not, meaning, you do not validate if it was successful or not.
- Shell/bash scripts are not suppose use `sudo`, inside, the code needs to stop automatically when permissions are not sufficient.
